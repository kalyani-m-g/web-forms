 Web Form
A simple, styled web form for practicing HTML5 inputs, CSS, and validation techniques.

 What did you learn while making this app?

- How to leverage HTML5 validation attributes like `required`, `minlength`, and `pattern` to enforce input rules without heavy JavaScript.
- How to overlay a transparent form on a pastel, Pinterest-style background using CSS properties like `background`, `background-size: cover`, and `rgba()` layering.
- Basic project structure organization—separating HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`style.css`), and assets (`images/` folder) for clarity and maintainability.

 What feature did you enjoy building the most?

Hands-down, placing the transparent form container over that dreamy pastel background was the most satisfying. It’s a small design move, but it dramatically transformed a barebones form into something visually engaging. Clean layout + aesthetic flair = instant win.

 What would you add next if you had more time?

- Real-time validation feedback (e.g., inline error messages or green checkmarks) to make the form smarter and user-friendly.
- Responsive tweaks for mobile devices—adjusting padding, font sizes, and layout so everything looks crisp on small screens.
- Enhanced visuals, like subtle hover animations, transitions, or icons to elevate the user experience.
